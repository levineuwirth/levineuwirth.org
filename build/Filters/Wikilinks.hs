-- | Wikilink syntax preprocessor.
--
--   Applied to the raw Markdown source string /before/ Pandoc parsing.
--   Transforms:
--
--   * @[[Page Title]]@           → @[Page Title](/page-title)@
--   * @[[Page Title|Display]]@   → @[Display](/page-title)@
--
--   The URL slug is derived from the page title: lowercased, spaces
--   replaced with hyphens, non-alphanumeric characters stripped, and
--   a @.html@ suffix appended so the link resolves identically under
--   the dev server, file:// previews, and nginx in production.
--
--   Code protection (honest scope): lines inside /fenced/ code blocks
--   are passed through untouched (see 'mapOutsideFences'), and within a
--   line, inline code spans (backtick runs, CommonMark equal-length
--   matching) are skipped — so both fenced and @`inline`@ examples can
--   show @[[…]]@ literally. Indented code blocks and code spans that
--   cross a line break are NOT recognised; a wikilink inside those is
--   still rewritten.

-- Fence-aware line mapping (shared by all source-level preprocessors)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Apply a line transformation to every line that is not part of a
--   fenced code block. Shared by the three source-level preprocessors
--   (wikilinks here, 'Filters.Transclusion', 'Filters.EmbedPdf') so
--   their directive syntax can be quoted literally inside fenced code.
--
--   Fence tracking follows CommonMark: an opener is at most three
--   spaces of indentation followed by a run of at least three backticks
--   or tildes (longer runs allowed); for backtick fences the info
--   string may not contain a backtick. The closer uses the same fence
--   character, a run at least as long as the opener, and nothing but
--   whitespace after it. An unclosed fence extends to the end of the
--   document. Fence delimiter lines themselves pass through untouched.
--
--   Honest scope: only /fenced/ code blocks are protected. Indented
--   code blocks and inline code spans are not recognised here — a
--   directive inside either is still rewritten.

-- Route shape
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Top-level slugs whose Hakyll route is a directory index
--   (@\<slug\>\/index.html@, served as @\/\<slug\>\/@) rather than the
--   flat @\<slug\>.html@ every other standalone page uses.
--
--   Both source-level preprocessors resolve a bare slug to a URL
--   without access to Hakyll's route table — the substitution happens
--   on the raw Markdown string, long before any route exists — so the
--   handful of generated pages that route to a directory have to be
--   named here. Keep this in sync with the @create [\"\<slug\>\/index.html\"]@
--   rules in @build\/Stats.hs@; a slug missing from this list produces a
--   link to a page that does not exist (the @\/build.html@ 404 that
--   motivated it).
--
--   Authors can also bypass the table entirely by writing the directory
--   form explicitly — @{{build\/}}@ — which 'Filters.Transclusion' maps
--   to itself.
directoryRouteSlugs :: [String]
directoryRouteSlugs = ["build", "stats"]

-- | Root-relative path (no leading slash) for a bare slug: the
--   directory form for 'directoryRouteSlugs', @\<slug\>.html@ otherwise.
--
--   A slug that already spells out a directory index —
--   @essays\/deep-dive\/index.html@, which is the shape of the Hakyll
--   route for every @content\/essays\/\<slug\>\/index.md@ — collapses to
--   the directory form (audit C03). Serving the same page under two
--   spellings splits every URL-keyed thing the site keeps: the canonical
--   link, the sitemap, the backlink join, and the per-page localStorage
--   keys in @annotations.js@ and @collapse.js@. Only one of them can be
--   the address, and everywhere else on the site it is @\/essays\/x\/@.

--   for @[@ and @]@ are not themselves re-escaped.
--
--   Deliberately NOT escaped: @_@, @*@, @\`@, @<@. Those are inline
