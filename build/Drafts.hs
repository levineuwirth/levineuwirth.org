-- | @draft: true@ in a page's front matter: unpublished in production.
--
-- The flag used to be honored only on poetry and fiction collection
-- landings; anywhere else it was silently ignored and the piece shipped
-- with its feed, sitemap and search entries (audit C06). Now a production
-- build withholds it in two places, together airtight:
--
--   * 'Patterns' excludes 'unpublishedPattern' from every content pattern,
--     so the lists Hakyll builds while the rules run — tags, authors,
--     pagination, keyword maps — never contain it;
--   * 'withoutUnpublished' drops every compiler and resource for it from
--     the finished rule set, so no rule (a literal glob, an asset copy)
--     can route it, and a compile-time @loadAll@, which only sees what
--     rules claimed, cannot find it.
--
-- (Hakyll's @ignoreFile@ would be the natural place, but it is given bare
-- file names, and a draft is known by its path.) @SITE_ENV=dev@ builds
-- ignore the flag, as they include @content/drafts/@.
--
-- What the flag withholds:
--
--   * the file itself — essay, poem, story, blog post, composition,
--     photograph, standalone or collection page;
--   * for a directory-form entry (@content/{essays,music,photography}/<slug>/index.md@),
--     its whole directory: figures, scores, recordings, a series' frames;
--   * for a flat photograph (@content/photography/<slug>.md@), the image
--     files that share its stem or its @photo:@ field's stem.
--
-- A poetry, fiction or blog collection's @index.md@ withholds only that
-- landing page; the pieces inside publish on their own flags.
--
-- Deliberately separate from @status: Draft@ (the epistemic state "Marks"
-- reads) and from @content/drafts/@ (a directory of unfinished essays).
