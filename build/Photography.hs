-- | Photography section — routing and per-page compilation.
--
--   Phase 1 (current): single-photo entries in flat and directory form,
--   plus the @/photography/@ landing page that lists every entry.
--
--   Phase 5 will extend this module with:
--     * collection-photo files (@content/photography/<series>/<photo>.md@)
--     * series landing pages
--     * @/photography/by-year/@ chronological indexes
--     * @/photography/contact-sheet/@ alternate view
--     * @/photography/feed.xml@ Atom feed
--     * @/photography/map/@ Leaflet map (Phase 4)
--
--   See @PHOTOGRAPHY.md@ at the repo root for the full design and
--   phased implementation plan.

-- | All photography rules. Called from 'Site.rules' once.
--
--   Order is intentional:
--
--     1. Co-located assets first (so the photo file is in @_site/@
--        before any page that references it is compiled — Hakyll's
--        dependency tracker handles this anyway, but the surface
--        ordering reads top-down by data flow).
--     2. Single-photo entries (flat + directory form).
--     3. Section landing at @/photography/@ — loaded after the
--        photo entries so its @loadAll photographyPattern@ resolves
--        each photo's frontmatter through 'photographyCtx'.
photographyRules :: Rules ()
photographyRules = do
    -- A directory is a "series" iff it has @.md@ siblings alongside
    -- its @index.md@. Collected once at rule-gen time so the entry

-- | Co-located assets — the photo file itself, and (Phase 3) the
--   generated @{photo}.exif.yaml@ + @{photo}.palette.yaml@ sidecars.
--   Two patterns are matched in sequence:
--
--     * @content/photography/<asset>@        — flat-single co-located assets
--     * @content/photography/<slug>/<asset>@ — directory-form co-located assets
--
--   Markdown files are excluded from both rules; they're compiled by
--   'photographyEntryRules' and 'photographyLandingRules'.
--
--   The @.exif.yaml@ / @.palette.yaml@ sidecars produced by Phase 3
--   tooling will be added to the @.gitignore@ defense-in-depth list,
--   but copying them through the asset rule is harmless if a stray
--   one slips into the repo. The build is not load-bearing on
--   sidecar absence.
