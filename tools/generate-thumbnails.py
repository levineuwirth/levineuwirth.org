generate-thumbnails.py — Responsive delivery variants for photography.

The problem (audit finding P01). Every photography surface — the card
grids, the contact sheet, the series lead, the map tooltips — pointed
at the full 2400px delivery JPEG. A contact sheet slot is ~220 CSS
pixels wide and a map tooltip is 224; the browser downloaded ~800 KB
to paint each of them, and a single index page cost 32–40 MB.

The fix is not a smaller delivery file (the lightbox and the detail
page genuinely want 2400px) but a ladder of siblings the template can
offer through `srcset`, letting the browser pick.

NAMING CONTRACT (the Hakyll context and the templates depend on it):

    content/photography/<series>/<name>.<ext>
      -> <name>.w480.<ext>
         <name>.w960.<ext>
         <name>.w1440.<ext>

  * Same directory, same extension, same colour profile.
  * A variant is emitted only when the source is STRICTLY wider than
    that width. A 1200px source yields w480 and w960, never w1440 —
    upscaling buys nothing and lies to the browser about what it got.
  * A variant is never itself a source. Files matching
    `\\.w(480|960|1440)\\.(jpe?g|png)$` are skipped on the walk, so
    reruns cannot produce `photo.w960.w480.jpg`.
  * JPEG: quality 82, progressive, optimize. PNG: optimize, alpha
    preserved.
  * A WebP sibling of every variant (`<name>.w960.webp`), encoded from
    the same resized image: quality 80, method 6 (lossless for a PNG
    source). tools/convert-images.sh used to make these with cwebp from
    the finished JPEG variant; compressing an already-lossy 960px image a
    second time saved about 3 % and lost detail, and a quarter of them
    came out larger than the JPEG. From the source pixels, quality 80 is
    22 % smaller than the JPEG at equal or better SSIM (30-photo sample,
    2026-10-04). convert-images.sh still covers the full-size delivery
    files and everything outside photography, and skips these because
    they are newer than their JPEG.
  * No EXIF. The delivery sources are already stripped by
    tools/import-photo.sh (the metadata lives in the .exif.yaml
    sidecar); Pillow writes none unless asked, and we do not ask. An
    embedded ICC profile IS carried across, because dropping it would
    change how the variant renders next to its own source.

Determinism. Rerunning with unchanged sources rewrites nothing: a
variant that exists and is newer than its source is skipped. Every
write goes to a PID-unique temp name and is renamed into place, so an
interrupted run cannot leave a truncated variant that is newer than
its source and therefore skipped forever. (That is the exact trap
tools/convert-images.sh documents for .webp.)

Ordering in `make build`. This runs BEFORE tools/convert-images.sh, so
the variants get .webp companions of their own, and before
tools/extract-dimensions.py, which skips variants (their dimensions
are derivable from the source, and 1000+ sidecars of pure churn help
nobody).

Usage:
    tools/generate-thumbnails.py [ROOT] [--dry-run] [--force] [--prune]

    ROOT       directory to walk, or one image (default:
               content/photography)
    --dry-run  report what would change; write and delete nothing
    --force    rewrite variants even when they look current
    --prune    delete variants whose source is gone, or that the
               contract no longer permits (source no longer wider)

Exit status is 0 for a clean run and 0 when Pillow is absent — the
build continues, exactly as tools/convert-images.sh continues without
cwebp, and the missing srcset targets are then the artifact gate's
problem (tools/check-site.py). A genuine conversion failure exits 1.
