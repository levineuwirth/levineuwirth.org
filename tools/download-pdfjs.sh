# download-pdfjs.sh — Vendor Mozilla's prebuilt PDF.js viewer into static/pdfjs/.
#
# The Haskell link filter (build/Filters/Links.hs) rewrites every root-relative
# .pdf link to open through /pdfjs/web/viewer.html, so this viewer must be
# present in static/ for the site build to produce working PDF links.
#
# Runs on every `make build`; the extracted viewer is gitignored (~18 MB).
#
# What "already installed" means
# ------------------------------
# It used to mean "web/viewer.html exists". That hid two failures:
#
#   * Bumping PDFJS_VERSION did nothing. The old viewer stayed in place and
#     the site kept shipping it, with no message saying so.
#   * An extraction interrupted after viewer.html was written looked
#     complete forever, leaving a viewer whose pdf.worker.mjs is missing.
#
# So the installed copy now carries a .version stamp, and a run is a no-op
# only when that stamp matches the requested pin AND every file in
# REQUIRED_FILES is present and non-empty. Anything else reinstalls.
#
# The reinstall is staged: the archive is extracted into a sibling
# directory, stripped, and inventory-checked there, and only a staging tree
# that passes is renamed over the live one. A `rename(2)` within static/ is
# atomic, so a concurrent site build sees either the old complete viewer or
# the new complete viewer, never a half-written one.
#
# To bump the pinned version, set PDFJS_VERSION, re-run, then update
# tools/pdfjs-checksums.sha256 with the new archive SHA-256.
#
# Test-only overrides:
#   PDFJS_DIR           install somewhere other than static/pdfjs
#   PDFJS_ARCHIVE_PATH  use a local zip instead of downloading
