"""
extract-dimensions.py — Build-time pixel-dimension sidecar generator.

Walks @static/images/@ and @content/**@ for raster image files
(JPEG / PNG / GIF) and writes a @{image}.dims.yaml@ sidecar alongside
each one containing the file's pixel width and height. Consumed by
@build/Filters/Images.hs@, which attaches matching @width@ and
@height@ attributes to every <img> tag at compile time — preventing
cumulative layout shift while images load.

This is the body-image counterpart to @extract-exif.py@, which writes
photography-specific @{image}.exif.yaml@ sidecars (containing
dimensions plus camera / lens / etc.). The two complement each other:
photography templates read width / height through the EXIF sidecar
via @photographyCtx@; everything else (essay figures, blog images,
inline images) gets dimensions through @{image}.dims.yaml@ via the
filter.

Strategy:
  * Pillow's @Image.size@ is independent of EXIF, so synthetic
    images (ImageMagick gradients, GIMP exports) and EXIF-stripped
    JPEGs both yield correct dimensions.
  * Staleness check: skip when sidecar mtime > image mtime.
  * Per-image failures are logged and the walk continues; the build
    never fails on a dimensions extraction error.

Called by `make build` when .venv exists. Failures on individual
images are logged and the rest of the walk continues.
