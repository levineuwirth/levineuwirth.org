embed.py — Build-time embedding pipeline.

Produces two outputs from _site/**/*.html:

  data/similar-links.json       Page-level similarity (for "Related" footer section)
  data/semantic-index.bin       Paragraph vectors as raw Float32 array (N × PARA_DIM)
  data/semantic-meta.json       Paragraph metadata: [{url, title, heading, excerpt}]

Two models, one process:

  * Pages use nomic-embed-text-v1.5 (768 dims) — build-time only, never
    shipped to the browser. Chosen for its well-separated cosine scores on
    small corpora, which keeps the MIN_SCORE gate meaningful so every essay
    reliably gets a "Related" footer section.

  * Paragraphs use all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dims) — must match what the
    browser runs via transformers.js (static/js/semantic-search.js) since
    query vectors are dotted against the shipped index.

Called by `make build` when .venv exists. Failures are non-fatal.

Staleness: both passes are content-hash cached (data/embed-cache-*.npz),
so an unchanged site re-embeds nothing and loads no model. Extraction is
cached too (data/embed-cache-extract.json): a page is parsed only when
its bytes, footer build time aside, or the extractor changed. A content
hash rather than an mtime, which cannot see changed content behind an
unchanged mtime (the compression cache's lesson, audit X2).

Cost of a fully-warm run: every page is read and hashed, none parsed,
and torch / sentence-transformers are imported lazily only when a cache
miss actually requires embedding. Parsing every page with BeautifulSoup
had been nearly all of a no-change run (about 3.5 of 3.9 s).

# Two models, deliberately split:

#   PARA_MODEL — embeds paragraphs for data/semantic-index.bin. This index

#   computed client-side. The client (static/js/semantic-search.js) embeds
#   queries with MiniLM-L6-v2 via transformers.js, so the build-time model
#   must match exactly — both the architecture and the embedding dimension
#   are part of the wire contract.
#
#   PAGE_MODEL — embeds full pages for data/similar-links.json. This file
#   is consumed only at Hakyll-build time (SimilarLinks.hs) and never
#   shipped to the browser, so it is free to use a different, stronger
#   model. nomic-embed-text-v1.5 produces well-separated cosine scores on
#   small corpora (top neighbours at 0.7–0.9 instead of MiniLM's compressed
#   0.1–0.3), so the MIN_SCORE gate below is meaningful and every essay
#   reliably gets a "Related" footer section.
