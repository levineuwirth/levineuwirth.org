"""
extract-palette.py — Build-time 5-color palette sidecar for photography.

Walks content/photography/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png} and writes a
{photo}.palette.yaml sidecar alongside each image, containing five
hex colors derived from the photograph via colorthief's k-means-like
quantisation. The sidecar is consumed by photographyCtx in Hakyll
and rendered as the thin <div class="photo-palette"> strip beneath
each photo.

Frontmatter `palette:` always wins. Authors can override the auto
extraction for artistic reasons (e.g. exposing brand-aligned tones
that aren't statistically dominant in the pixels). The sidecar is
the fallback so authors don't need to write hex codes by hand.

Staleness check: skips an image whose sidecar mtime > image mtime.

Called by `make build` when .venv exists. Per-image failures are
logged and the rest of the walk continues; the build never fails on
a palette extraction error.

# Clustering a 2400x1600 image to find five colours is almost entirely wasted

# sample has the same distribution. Pillow's draft() asks the JPEG decoder for
# a reduced-scale decode, which is a different and much cheaper operation than
# decoding fully and then resizing. Measured on a 2400px frame: 0.297 s before,
# 0.191 s after, with the dominant swatch moving from #465129 to #47512a — a
# difference no eye will find on a 40px strip.
