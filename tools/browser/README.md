# Browser harness

Playwright scripts that drive Chromium and Firefox over the built site, from
the 2026-10-01 audit and later checks. They print a line per route and dump
JSON, and assert nothing themselves. The browser tests
(`tests/test_browser_*.py`, `make test-browser`) run `csp_run.py` and assert
on what it records (`tests/test_browser_csp.py`), and drive fixture pages of
their own through `serve.py --fixtures`: popups with every provider's answer
faked, dates, the slideshow, the Random link, the footer and three
robustness fixes; the search page, keyword search over the built
Pagefind index and semantic search with its model and index faked; and
highlights, the selection toolbar, collapsible sections (and printing
them) and sidenotes; photography (view modes, masonry, the map with its data
and tiles faked, the lightbox and slideshow on real pages), the equation
gallery, and the score reader with its following (real scores and
recordings); and, offline, `axe_run.py`, `kbd_run.py`, `overflow_run.py`,
`motion_run.py` and `perf_run.py` (`tests/test_browser_a11y.py`,
`tests/test_browser_layout.py`), against the known issues and budgets in
`tests/browser-baseline/`, each report required to hold every page and
variant asked of it (`tests/test_browser_harness.py` checks the keyboard
probe's own answer on cases with a known one). The
other scripts here are still reports; `popup_run.py` meets the live
providers, and `csp_run.py` the live model, which the tests do not.

## Running

```sh
uv sync                                      # Playwright is in pyproject's dev group
.venv/bin/playwright install chromium firefox
make build                                   # they read _site/
.venv/bin/python tools/browser/serve.py --root _site --port 48731 --csp "<policy>" \
    --mode enforce --log .browser-runs/csp-reports.jsonl &
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:48731/   # 200, or nothing below is real
.venv/bin/python tools/browser/csp_run.py chromium 48731 csp-chromium.json [route ...]
```

`--port 0` takes any free port, which the server names on its first line.

**Check that the server answers first.** If it is down, every page fails to
load and the scripts still print `csp=0 … bad=0`; only the `failed` field in
the JSON shows the refused connections.

Results and screenshots go to `$BROWSER_OUT`, or `.browser-runs/` at the
repository root (gitignored). Routes are in `lib.py`: 43, every page type
and the 404 page. `playwright install` fetches the browsers that match the
installed Playwright; there is no WebKit here.
`axe_run.py` needs axe-core as `axe.min.js` in this directory (gitignored):
`fetch_axe.py` fetches the version and checksum `axe-version` records, and
`make test-browser` runs it. `BROWSER_PORT` points a script at another
server, and `BROWSER_OFFLINE=1` refuses every request that would leave it.

## Scripts

| script | checks |
|---|---|
| `serve.py` | serves `_site/` as the production vhost does: `try_files`, the internal 404 page, `.gz`/`.br` sidecars and Range, the security and framing headers, a given CSP (enforcing or report-only), `/proxy/*` → 404, `/csp-report` logged; with `--fixtures DIR` (e.g. `fixture/`), also `/__fixture/` from that directory |
| `csp_run.py` | per route: CSP violations, console and page errors, element load errors, failed requests, feature probes (PDF.js pages, thumbnails and print among them) |
| `interact_run.py` | keyboard interaction: settings, lightbox, slideshow, math gallery, popups, portals, filters |
| `kbd_run.py` | tab order, focus visibility, skip link, traps, Escape, on the 16 pages of its `KROUTES` |
| `axe_run.py` | axe-core per route (all but PDF.js's viewer, its `SKIP`), viewport and theme |
| `nojs_run.py` | pages with JavaScript off |
| `overflow_run.py` | horizontal overflow on every route at several widths |
| `motion_run.py` | reduced motion, from the OS and from the site's setting, on the 14 pages of its `MROUTES` |
| `perf_run.py` | requests, bytes, LCP and CLS on the local server, and the other origins each page asks for, on the 21 pages of its `PROUTES` |
| `popup_run.py` | every link-popup provider |
| `printcheck.py` | PDF.js thumbnails and print images under the CSP |
| `prod_smoke.py` | a few checks against production; aborts `/csp-report` so test traffic never reaches the report log |
| `cls_check.py`, `footer_check.py` | layout shift, and the footer build time from `/build/time.txt` |
