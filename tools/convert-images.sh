# Walks static/ and content/ for JPEG and PNG files and calls cwebp to produce
# a .webp file alongside each one.  Existing .webp files are skipped (safe to
# re-run).  If cwebp is not found the script exits 0 so the build continues.

# Photography's .w480/.w960/.w1440 variants arrive with WebP siblings that
# tools/generate-thumbnails.py encoded from the source pixels (it runs first
# in `make build`); they are newer than their JPEG, so this skips them. It
# covers the full-size delivery files and every other image.
#
# Requires: cwebp — Arch ships it in libwebp-utils (NOT libwebp, which
#   is library-only). Debian/Ubuntu ship it in the webp package.
#   Install: pacman -S libwebp-utils  /  apt install webp
#
# Quality: -q 85 is a good default for photographic content.  For images that
# are already highly compressed, -lossless avoids further degradation.

    # But "correct and silently 3x heavier" is exactly the failure the

    # one-line note nobody read. So the notice is loud, and the production
    # knob is `tools/check-site.py --require-webp`, which fails on any
    # JPEG/PNG missing its WebP companion, including partial conversion.

  ==============================================================
   WARNING: cwebp not found — full-size WebP conversion skipped.
  ==============================================================

   Existing WebPs and photo variants made by Pillow remain usable.
   Images without WebP companions fall back to JPEG/PNG. The site
   stays usable, but those images ship more bytes.

   Install the converter:

     Arch    pacman -S libwebp-utils     <- NOT libwebp; that
                                            package is the
                                            library only and
                                            has no cwebp binary
     Debian  apt install webp
     macOS   brew install webp

   Then re-run `make build`. To make this a hard failure in a
   production build, run:  tools/check-site.py _site --require-webp
   (`make validate REQUIRE_WEBP=1`).
