# download-leaflet.sh — Vendor Leaflet + leaflet.markercluster into static/leaflet/.
#
# The /photography/map/ page (build/Photography.hs photographyMapRules)
# loads Leaflet from /leaflet/ to render a map of geo-tagged photos.
#
# Scope of this vendoring: the *library* — JS, CSS, and marker sprites —
# is served from this origin, so no third party sees a request for it and
# no CDN outage can break the page's scripting. The *map itself* is not
# offline. Tiles still come from Carto:
#
#   static/js/photography-map.js:
#     https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png
#
# so a visitor loading /photography/map/ makes third-party requests to
# basemaps.cartocdn.com for every tile, and the map renders empty if that
# host is unreachable or blocked. Vendoring the library removes one
# dependency, not the dependency. Serving tiles from this origin would
# mean self-hosting a tile set — deliberately out of scope.
#
# Run once before deploying. The vendored copy is gitignored
# (~150 KB total); re-running is safe — files that already exist AND
# match their pinned checksum are skipped; anything missing or
# mismatched is re-fetched.
#
# To bump the pinned versions, set LEAFLET_VERSION / MARKERCLUSTER_VERSION
# and re-run with ALLOW_UNPINNED=1, then add the lines it prints to
# tools/leaflet-checksums.sha256. Without a pinned line a file is refused
# (tools/pin-check.sh).
