# sign-site.sh — Detach-sign every HTML file in _site/ with the signing subkey.
#
# Requires the passphrase to be pre-cached via tools/preset-signing-passphrase.sh.
# Produces <file>.html.sig alongside each <file>.html.
#
# Usage (called by `make sign`):
#   ./tools/sign-site.sh [site-dir]
#
# A page whose content has not changed keeps its signature. Each run records,
# in $SIGN_MANIFEST (data/sign-manifest.txt, headed by the key and the site
# directory), the SHA-256 of every page it leaves signed and of that page's
# .sig as it wrote or kept it. A signature is reused only when both still
# match: the page is the content it signed, and the .sig is the file it made
# for it, not one swapped, edited or left from another page. Anything else
# is signed again. A content hash, not an mtime: an mtime rule
# misses changed content behind an unchanged mtime, as the compression cache
# found (audit X2). Until 2026-10-06 every page changed on every build (the
# footer time was stamped into each), so every deploy re-signed and re-sent
# all ~500. SIGN_ALL=1 signs every page. Coverage is unaffected either way —
# the post-sign check below still requires a non-empty .sig for every .html
# before the script exits 0.
