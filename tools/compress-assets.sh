#!/usr/bin/env bash
# compress-assets.sh — Generate .gz (and .br, if brotli is installed) sidecars
# for compressible text assets in _site/.
#
# Pairs with nginx `gzip_static on` / `brotli_static on`: nginx serves the
# pre-compressed file when the client advertises a matching Accept-Encoding,
# so each build pays the compression cost once (at brotli -q 11) instead of
# the server paying it on every request.
#
# Only files >= MIN_SIZE bytes are compressed — below that, the compression
# framing overhead can exceed the savings.
#
# Sidecars come from a cache keyed by the SHA-256 of the source's bytes
# ($COMPRESS_CACHE, data/.compress-cache by default; it survives `site --
# clean`). A source whose bytes were compressed before, in this build or any
# earlier one, costs a hash and a reflink copy; only new bytes go through
# brotli -q 11. Before, reuse was decided by mtimes: the brotli CLI copies its
# input's mtime to its output, so every .br looked stale and all 342 MB were
# recompressed on every build (audit X2/D01), and no mtime rule can see
# changed content behind an unchanged mtime. A hash sees both. Entries unused
# for 30 days are pruned.
#
# Three ways a sidecar can go stale, all handled here because nginx serves
# it in preference to the source whenever the client sends the matching
# Accept-Encoding — a stale sidecar is a *wrong response*, not a slow one:
#
#   1. The source shrank below MIN_SIZE. The old sidecar is not overwritten
#      (nothing is compressed), so it keeps decoding to the previous, larger
#      content. Deleted here.
#   2. The source was deleted. Its sidecars are orphans that nginx will
#      still happily serve. Swept here, but only when the stripped name has
#      one of the compressible extensions below, so an intentionally
#      published foo.tar.gz is never touched.
#   3. The compressor was interrupted or produced garbage. Every sidecar
#      this run writes is decompressed and `cmp`-ed against its source
#      before it is moved into place.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/compress-assets.sh              # compress _site/
#   ./tools/compress-assets.sh path/to/dir  # compress a specific directory
#
# MIN_SIZE is overridable (bytes); the directory argument is what tests use
# to run this against a scratch tree.
