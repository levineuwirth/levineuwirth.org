"""music-import.py — bring a MuseScore score onto the site, and keep it there.

Score pages are derived artifacts, like the photography delivery JPEGs:
git carries each composition's index.md and a small score-source.yaml
manifest, and the pages themselves are regenerated from the engraver's
source and deployed through _site/. (See the note in .gitignore.)

    tools/music-import.py import <score.mscz> <slug> [--pdf] [--audio]
    tools/music-import.py refresh [<slug> ...] [--force] [--audio]
    tools/music-import.py check

import   Exports one SVG per page into content/music/<slug>/scores/,
         optionally a PDF, and writes score-source.yaml. For a new piece
         it also scaffolds index.md — title, year, duration, category and
         the movements (numeral, tempo, reader page, duration), all read
         from the score. An existing index.md is never touched; the
         computed movements are compared against it instead.
refresh  Re-exports pieces from their manifests (all of them by default):
         the fresh-clone path, and the re-engrave path.
--movements 1-2
         Publishes only the leading movements — for a work whose later
         movements are in revision. The pages stop before the first withheld
         movement, which must therefore begin on a new page; the realization
         and its timing stop at its first downbeat. The choice is recorded in
         the manifest, and `--movements all` publishes the whole work again.
         List the withheld movements in index.md with `status: in revision`.
--engraver mscore3
         Engraves with MuseScore 3.6.2 (`mscore3`) instead of 4, for a score
         saved in MuseScore 3: 4 reflows such a score and drops what was
         placed by hand. Pages and bar positions come from 3; a realization
         still comes from 4 (Muse Sounds needs it), its timing matched to
         the MuseScore 3 layout bar by bar. MuseScore 3's bundled Qt has no
         headless platform, so it runs against the desktop's X display.
--audio  Also renders a MIDI realization with Muse Sounds, and writes
         scores/timing.json: when each bar sounds, and where it stands on
         its page. The reader uses the two to follow the score while it
         plays. Both come from one playback of one layout, so they agree
         by construction — repeats included, since the timing lists bars
         in the order they are played.
check    Reports every composition whose score is missing or stale.

Why refresh refuses to change the page count without --force: unlike a
photo resize, a re-export is not reproducible. A newer MuseScore can
reflow the layout (the 3.6 → 4.x Violin Sonata moved whole systems), and
a reflow moves every movement's `page:` in index.md with it — a silent
wrong jump in the reader. The manifest records the page count and the
MuseScore version so that change is caught and named.

Source paths are stored relative to MUSIC_SCORES_DIR (default
~/Documents/Scores) so the manifest does not publish a home directory.

Requires MuseScore 4's `mscore` on PATH; runs headless.
