"""The walk the sidecar extractors share (extract-exif, extract-palette,
extract-dimensions): which images get a sidecar, when one is stale, and how
it is written. Each extractor supplies its suffix, its reader and the key
order it writes.

Responsive variants (tools/photo_naming.py) get none: they are pixel
reductions of a source that already has its own sidecars, and nothing reads
a sidecar for a srcset candidate, so extracting for them would add ~1100
files of churn for no consumer.
