# Opening section

Plain prose with "smart quotes" -- an en dash --- an em dash, and an
ellipsis... Abbreviations: e.g. this, i.e. that (cf. the other), and one
ending a line, e.g.
here, and one with a comma, i.e., like so. Then
here. NASA and
HTML go to small caps, and so does [explicit]{.smallcaps} text.

A cited claim [@alpha2001] and a cluster [@beta2010; @alpha2001], then the
first book again [@alpha2001, p. 4]. The book is also listed for further
reading, which is the case that once cost its first citation its anchor.

A note.^[A sidenote with a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footnote)
and math $a+b$.] A second note.^[The second note cites [@beta2010].]

## Code and math

```python
print("[[not a wikilink]]")
{{not-a-transclusion}}
```

Inline $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, and display:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

## What "consumed" means, e.g. for $K_4$

A heading with quotation marks, an abbreviation Typography wraps in
`<abbr>`, and math: the TOC entry must keep all three (audit H03).
