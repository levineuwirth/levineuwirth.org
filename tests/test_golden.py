"""Golden pages: the Haskell filters, through the real pipeline, against
saved HTML.

The Pandoc filters in build/Filters/ and build/Citations.hs carry most of
the site's behaviour (sidenotes, citations and their back-links, wikilinks,
transclusion and PDF placeholders, small caps, link classification, WebP
<picture>s, score fragments, figure numbering) and had no tests of their
own: a page either built or it did not. A change that moved an id or
dropped a class went unnoticed until a reader followed the link.

Each tests/golden/<name>.md is rendered with ``site render-fixture``
(build/Golden.hs), which runs the same steps as Compilers.essayCompiler
without Hakyll, and compared with tests/golden/<name>.html. A fixture is
never published, and its sources never change, so a difference is always
the pipeline's.

When a difference is intended, review it, then regenerate:

    UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 .venv/bin/python3 -m unittest tests.test_golden

Regenerating cannot bless a broken page: InvariantTests checks every render
for the defects a golden diff is easiest to wave through — an anchor that
leads nowhere, a duplicated id, an unresolved figure reference, a wikilink
or directive left in the prose.

The generator is built first (``cabal build``, a no-op when it is current),
so the render is never from a stale binary.
